# Aigaion

Aigaion is a php/mysql based multi-user system for managing annotated bibliographies. It allows the user(s) to order publications in a self-chosen (overlapping) topic structure, offers BibTex and RIS import and export and has an intuitive user interface.

Aigaion is an old application that was adapted in 2021 to run up to PHP 7.4.

Currently looking for contributors and co-maintainer(s) to handle updates and modernization.
